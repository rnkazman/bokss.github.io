# 1st International Workshop on the Body of Knowledge for Software Sustainability (BoKSS'21) 

- Co-located with [ICSE 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021) (under submission)
- Virtual 
- June 1-2, 2021 (two half days, see program below)
- Registratration [OPEN](https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2021/registration)

## Theme & Goals

With the pervasive role of software and digitalization in all aspects of contemporary society, the topic of sustainability is becoming increasingly important and increasingly urgent for software engineers and software engineering education. But we have a scant foundation of practices, examples, tools, datasets, guidelines etc. upon which to make principled engineering decisions and upon which to build a curriculum. In spite of the active international research community in the field, we lack a strong foundation of significant and reusable results upon which to build tangible progress that helps contribute to the target sustainability goals.

The goal of BoKSS 2021 is to create such a knowledge base. We seek to create a knowledge base of actionable results that will transform sustainable software engineering practices from a novel research area into a robust, repeatable, teachable practice area within software engineering.

In addition to the knowledge base mentioned above, the envisaged workshop outcomes include forming a concrete work-force that will create (i) an online platform to share the knowledge base, and (ii) a scientific report targeting journal publication which will present the Body of Knowledge for Sustainability in Software Engineering (BoKSS) as a unified theory. Depending on the number of participants and their contributions, we can imagine more than one report resulting from this workshop.

## Topics of Interest

BoKSS 2021 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to sustainable software and software for sustainability:
- Practices for software sustainability
- Metrics and measures for software sustainability
- Applied, or experimented with, software engineering methodologies at all levels (from requirements elicitation to architecture design, coding, testing)
- Patterns and anti-patterns
- Architectural tactics, architectural styles and design patterns

## Workshop Program 
**Before** the workshop days, we will setup a Slack Channel for all registered participants. We will use it to kickstart the working groups to build the BoKSS and plan for joint papers.
The **workshop** itself is organized in **two half-days**, each opening and closing with a plenary, with in-between independent working groups. **More details to come.**

#### DAY 1: 14:00-17:30 CET
- *13:45-14:00 Joining us*
- **14:00-14:45** Keynote (TBA)
- *14:45-14:55 Break*
- **14:55-15:40** The Vision of a BoKSS (P. Lago, R. Kazman) and Discussion
- *15:45-15:55 Switch to own working group*
- **15:55-17:00** independent work (parallel session 1)
- **17:00-17:30** Wrapup

#### DAY 2: 14:00-17:30 CET
- **14:00-14:15** Kickstart - 15 minutes
- **14:15-15:00** independent work (parallel session 2)
- *15:00-15:15 Break*
- **15:15-16:30** independent work (parallel session 3)
- **16:30-17:30** Wrapup and Future work


## Submission Guidelines 

Prospective participants are invited to submit two types of contributions:
- Full papers (max 8 pages) will describe concrete contributions to the BoKSS. They will be structured as follows:
--- A description of the sustainability problem you address.
--- A description of the SE solution you propose.
-- A discussion of how results are measurable (e.g., KPIs).
-- A presentation of the evidence of contribution to sustainability, ideally including real world experiences.
-- A discussion of the costs and benefits of your approach.
-- A presentation of the transferable artifacts you are contributing e.g., replication package, code, examples, documentation, educational materials, case studies.

- Extended abstracts (max 2 pages) will describe a motivating challenge problem that has ideally emerged from practice. They will be structured as follows:
-- The context.
-- The challenge problem.
-- The current solution/s (if present) and their strengths and weaknesses.

Workshop papers must follow the [ICSE 2021 Format and Submission Guideline](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-papers#Call-for-Papers), but will use a *single blind* submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bokss2021). Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.
